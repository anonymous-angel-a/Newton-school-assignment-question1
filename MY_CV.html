                using PmodOLED to display chars using
                 SSD1306 displaycontroller and an SPI 
                 interface is used to configure display and 
                 send the bitmap data to the devicer, 
         then take the inputfrom the user and display results accordingly   </h6>
         <h6><b>Online Selling Platform:Designed a java program to create a 
             selling platform model where extensive multi-threadingand inter-thread
